# Reddit-Sentiment-NLP-for-Trading
I explore using reddit sentiment data to inform trading strategies. I derive market sentiment in two ways using the wallstreetbets subreddit; first- collecting comments from daily discussion submissions then running the VADER sentiment model to assess overall daily positive/negative sentiment, and second- collecting all submission titles per day then assessing daily bullish/bearish sentiment using keyword analysis. In the featurization phase, I apply Fourier transforms to smooth the two very noisy time-series datasets. Finally, in the strategy development phase, I explore two possible strategies. The first involves exploiting the spread between SPY (SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF) price and daily positive/negative sentiment. The second strategy involves training a LSTM (long short term memory) model to predict the next dayâ€™s SPY price based on bullish/bearish sentiment.
